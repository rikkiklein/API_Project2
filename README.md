This is a fullstack web application that incorporates 2 API's, a backend server, a frontend server and a NoSql database. (Mongo)

The 2 API's that are implemented in this application are:

1) http://openweathermap.org/api

2) https://pixabay.com/api/docs/

 - The application begins by displaying a search input box so that the user can search for a specified location of their choice.

 - Once the user submits their request, the display updates itself and the new location together with it's weather information and a selection of images are displayed.

- The user can save the location for later use and also has the ability to delete that location if they changed their mind.  The user can add comments as well.

- The user can save various images as well as changing the screen's background to the specified image.

- The user can delete the image/images as well.

- 2 clear all buttons have been implemented to allow the user a quick fix if they would like to delete all their locations or images in 1 click.  An alert has been implemented to ensure that the user is confident with their decision.
